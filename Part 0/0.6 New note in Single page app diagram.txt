    Note right of browser: User inserts data and clicks the save button to submit the form.

    Note right of browser: The browser doesn't reload the page due to the e.preventDefault() line in the form.onsubmit function. Instead, the form data is added to the notes array, and the redrawNotes() function is called to render the new note. The new note data is then sent to the server.
